FOSS Funders ([fossfunders.com](https://fossfunders.com/))

The goal of [FOSS Funders](https://fossfunders.com/) is to **make it weird for
companies _not_ to support Free and Open Source software**. The strategy is to
provide social validation by collecting logos in one place. Funny how logos
work. :-)

We link logos to pages where each company can give more details about their
FOSS funding program. If we simply link to GHS or OC profiles, that doesn't add
much value over what GitHub and Open Collective already do (or should be doing
better, they need leaderboards or some such). What we're looking to encourage
here is for each company to say in their own voice how they approach this
topic, so that we can learn from each other and best practices can emerge.

Levels of link awesomeness:

1. A tweet/post is fine to start.
1. Even better is a blog post about why this is important to your company, how
   you are approaching the topic, why you picked the projects you did, what
platforms you are using, maybe plans for the future, etc.
1. The best is a permanent page somewhere on a domain of yours that describes
   your funding program in detail.
